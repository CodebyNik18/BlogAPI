        <p>Good writing is like a windowpane. The best prose gets out of the way of the ideas it carries, letting meaning shine through without distraction or unnecessary ornamentation. This is harder than it sounds.</p>
        <p>Most writers, when they start out, feel the urge to demonstrate their intelligence through complexity — long sentences, obscure vocabulary, elaborate structures. But the reader does not care how hard you worked. The reader cares only about the experience of reading, and a difficult experience is rarely a rewarding one.</p>
        <p>The goal is clarity. Clarity of thought, clarity of structure, clarity of language. When you find yourself reaching for a complicated word, ask whether a simpler one would do. It almost always will.</p>
        <p>Writing simply is not the same as writing badly. A clear sentence can carry enormous weight. A plain word can resonate for years. What we are after is not the absence of style but the presence of precision — saying exactly what you mean, no more, no less.</p>
        <p>Start with the idea. Before you write a single word, know what you are trying to say. Not roughly, not approximately — exactly. If you cannot state your point in one clear sentence, you do not yet understand it well enough to write about it.</p>
